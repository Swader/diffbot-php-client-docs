"In other words, you give Diffbot a URL and it returns human-readable data "
"about it, but doesn't rely on what it finds in the source code - rather, it "
"reads the renders like humans do, visually extracting the human-directed "
"content to provide reliable information about what's actually being said on "
"the page being processed. In that effect, it is relatively untrickable by "
"over-optimized SEO meta content."

"By using the PHP client, the developer can interact with both the APIs and "
"the returned entities in an object oriented manner, rather than parse JSON "
"and extract data manually. The PHP client uses Guzzle to issue requests to "
"the API. It is currently built on top of Guzzle 5, and there are no "
"immediate plans to transition to the feature-lacking version 6."
