What it comes down to, is that you can tell Diffbot how to recognize certain areas of a web page, and have it translate that into JSON for you if none of the standard APIs do the trick. This allows for much more lightweight and specific calls, resulting in a quicker turnaround and (usually) more precise data. This method creates an instance of the :php:class:`Swader\\\\Diffbot\\\\Api\\\\Custom`. The method accepts two parameters: either a URL which to process, or the word \"crawl\" if used in conjunction with the :php:meth:`Swader\\\\Diffbot\\\\Diffbot::crawl` method (see below), and the name of the custom API to use.

The result of the call is a collection of :php:class:`Swader\\\\Diffbot\\\\Entity\\\\JobCrawl` objects, each with details about a defined job.
